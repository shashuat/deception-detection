## Objectives

To develop an enhanced lie detection system that can ingest video from multiple sources (e.g., YouTube links, file uploads, or live webcam input). Beyond binary classification, the system will generate a visual timeline heatmap, where color intensity reflects the model’s confidence—shifting toward red when deception is likely and green when truthfulness is strongly indicated.

# Timeline of Steps
Have a decent pipeline

we use ml-tool for trainer, weblite for fullstack

16 sept: develop web interface for ingestor -> chunking startegy (start naively go to LLM based) -> analyse each chunk with model -> feed back to interface

week later: add data preprocessing, find more data + chunking strategy imrpovements [s], more complex lie detection model

keep training
